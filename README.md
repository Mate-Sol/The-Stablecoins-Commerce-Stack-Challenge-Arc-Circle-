# DeFa — Ignyte Stablecoins Commerce Stack Challenge

> On-chain credit operating infrastructure for SME trade finance, settling in USDC. Deployed on **Arc Testnet** (Circle's stablecoin-native L1). Submission for the [Ignyte Stablecoins Commerce Stack Challenge](https://challenges.ignyte.ae/) hosted by **Arc / Circle** — Track 2: SME Trade Finance & Working Capital (primary) + Track 4: Agentic Economy (secondary).

## What is DeFa

DeFa is a factory-cloned credit-pool protocol. Liquidity Providers deposit USDC into risk-tiered pools, PSPs and SMEs draw against verified receivables, and KAM → CAD → CRO → Legal approvals gate every facility before an on-chain admin signs pool deployment. Repayment waterfalls are automated on-chain; defaults settle from a treasury reserve.

## Why Arc

Arc's stablecoin-native design fits the trade-finance use case better than a general-purpose L1:

- **USDC is the gas token.** SMEs and PSPs already hold USDC as working capital — they don't need to source a separate gas asset just to sign a drawdown.
- **6-decimal stablecoin math is first-class.** No wrapped variants, no bridge exposure, no cross-chain settlement risk on the drawdown leg.
- **Native compliance hooks + programmable settlement** lower the trust cost of moving off SWIFT for cross-border trade rails.

## Live demo

- **App**: https://defa-arc-hackathon.invoicemate.net *(deployment in progress — Jul 11)*
- **Access code**: `654321`
- **Chain**: Arc Testnet (chain id `5042002`)

## The full lifecycle in one flow

```
1.  PSP signs up             → creates KYB submission
2.  PSP requests facility    → status: KAM_REVIEW
3.  KAM approves             → status: CAD_REVIEW
4.  CAD approves             → status: CRO_REVIEW
5.  CRO approves + terms     → status: AWAITING_POOL_INIT
6.  On-chain admin signs     → factory.approvePsp + factory.createPool
7.  evmIndexer picks up      → pool visible on /pools within 90s
8.  LP deposits              → approve + deposit txs (2-step)
9.  PSP draws                → server signs as AGENT2, USDC to receiver
10. PSP repays               → principal + util fee + penalty split
11. LP redeems               → claimYield + claimPrincipal (2-step)
```

```

## Test coverage — 38 integration tests, all passing on real Arc Testnet

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| `e2eFlows.test.js` — auth, marketplace, deposit build-tx, faucet, gates, stubs | 18/18 |
| `lifecycleFlows.test.js` — PSP → KAM → CAD → CRO → onchain admin gating | 13/13 |
| `onchainFlows.test.js` — real approvePsp + createPool + faucet mint + BE state read | 7/7 |

Same suite runs green on Polygon Amoy (see sibling repo).

## Contract security posture

The `payfi_v1` contract set (in `contracts/`) uses:

- **~17K LOC of Foundry test coverage** across 26 test files — invariant, adversarial (4 rounds), differential, fuzz, gas-profile, view-mutation consistency, security-focused.
- **OpenZeppelin v5.x** primitives (`AccessControl`, `ReentrancyGuard`, `Clones`, `SafeERC20`).
- **EIP-1167 minimal proxies** for facility clones — cheap gas per facility.
- **`_disableInitializers` guard** on the implementation contract (only clones via the factory can be initialized).
- **WAD fixed-point math** with property-based invariant tests.
